# About Me
Hey! I'm Kaleb. Welcome to my Cloud Portfolio site.

I've been working in IT since 2018, starting the same way many in the industry have — getting my A+ certitication and landing that first Help Desk role. I've always invested significant time outside of work to grow my skills. This initially led me down the networking path, acquiring my CCNA certification. Later that foundation provided great value as I became interested in Cloud. I began exploring Azure, replicating my VMWare home lab to my personal Azure environment. I then earned my AZ-104 and transitioned into my current role as a System Administrator.

In 2025, I've focused on transitioning into the cloud-native space, working to build the skills needed to become a Cloud/DevOps Engineer. I've been learning Linux, Python, APIs, databases, Docker, Kubernetes, DevOps methodologies, and more. This site is a live project that demonstrates many of the skills I've acquired.

Some facts about me:
- Born and raised in Jersey City, where I still live with my fiancée
- I'm half Dominican, half Puerto Rican. AKA "Dominerican"
- I watch an unhealthy amount of basketball. My favorite NBA team is the OKC Thunder. (CHAMPS)
- I did sleep in front of MicroCenter to get a RTX 3080 during the GPU chip shortage...
